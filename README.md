About The Course
Are you ready to dive into the world of data engineering? In this beginner level course, you will gain a solid understanding of how data is stored, processed, and accessed in relational databases (RDBMSes). You will work with different types of databases that are appropriate for various data processing requirements. 

You will begin this course by being introduced to relational database concepts, as well as several industry standard relational databases, including IBM DB2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Next, youâ€™ll utilize RDBMS tools used by professionals such as phpMyAdmin and pgAdmin for creating and maintaining relational databases. You will also use the command line and SQL statements to create and manage tables. 

This course incorporates hands-on, practical exercises to help you demonstrate your learning. You will work with real databases and explore real-world datasets. You will create database instances and populate them with tables and data. 

At the end of this course, you will complete a final assignment where you will apply your accumulated knowledge from this course and demonstrate that you have the skills to: design a database for a specific analytics requirement, normalize tables, create tables and views in the database, load and access data.
