About The Course
Are you ready to dive into the world of data engineering? In this beginner level course, you will gain a solid understanding of how data is stored, processed, and accessed in relational databases (RDBMSes). You will work with different types of databases that are appropriate for various data processing requirements. 

You will begin this course by being introduced to relational database concepts, as well as several industry standard relational databases, including IBM DB2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Next, youâ€™ll utilize RDBMS tools used by professionals such as phpMyAdmin and pgAdmin for creating and maintaining relational databases. You will also use the command line and SQL statements to create and manage tables. 

This course incorporates hands-on, practical exercises to help you demonstrate your learning. You will work with real databases and explore real-world datasets. You will create database instances and populate them with tables and data. 

At the end of this course, you will complete a final assignment where you will apply your accumulated knowledge from this course and demonstrate that you have the skills to: design a database for a specific analytics requirement, normalize tables, create tables and views in the database, load and access data. 

MISSION
PostgreSQL: I can provide expert guidance on using PostgreSQL for creating, managing, and querying relational databases.

Database Design and Normalization: I can help you understand the principles of database design and how to normalize tables effectively for your analytics requirements.

SQL: I can assist you with writing SQL statements for creating tables, views, and for loading and accessing data.

Data Warehousing with PostgreSQL: While your course focuses on the basics, I can also provide insights into more advanced topics like data warehousing.

BI and Data Pipelines: As you progress in your data engineering journey, I can help you with BI using Python and data pipelines with Apache Airflow.

MISSION OBJECTIVES

Database Systems: Leveraging PostgreSQL for robust and efficient database management.

Data Warehousing: Applying data warehousing principles using PostgreSQL to handle large-scale data analytics.

Data Pipelines: Building and managing data pipelines with Apache Airflow.

Business Intelligence: Utilizing Python for insightful data analysis and business intelligence applications.

Datasets: Working with datasets from the Bloomberg Terminal.
